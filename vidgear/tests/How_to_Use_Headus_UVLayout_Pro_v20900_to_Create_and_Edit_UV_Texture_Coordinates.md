## What is UVLayout?
 
UVLayout is a tool that allows you to map 2D textures onto 3D surfaces. It does this by creating a UV map, which is a representation of how the 2D texture coordinates (U and V) correspond to the 3D surface coordinates (X, Y and Z). A good UV map minimizes distortion, stretching and seams in the texture, and maximizes the use of texture space.
 
## What are the features of Headus UVLayout Pro v2.09.00?
 
Headus UVLayout Pro v2.09.00 has many features that make it a powerful and efficient tool for UV mapping. Some of these features are:
 
- It supports polymeshes and subdivision surfaces, as well as NURBS and patches.
- It has a unique approach that gives you direct control over the shape and size of the UV islands, as well as the ability to cut, weld, move, rotate and scale them.
- It has a real-time 3D feedback that shows you how the texture looks on the model as you edit the UVs.
- It has a flattening algorithm that produces low distortion UVs in significantly less time than traditional methods.
- It has a packing algorithm that optimizes the use of texture space by automatically arranging the UV islands within the texture boundaries.
- It has a symmetry option that allows you to mirror the UVs across an axis or a plane.
- It has a relax option that smooths out the UVs to reduce distortion and stretching.
- It has a pin option that allows you to fix the position of certain UV points or islands.
- It has a grid option that allows you to snap the UVs to a grid for precise alignment.
- It has a color option that allows you to assign different colors to different UV islands for easy identification.
- It has a layer option that allows you to work on different parts of the model separately or together.
- It has a copy/paste option that allows you to transfer UVs from one model to another.
- It has an export option that allows you to save the UV map as an image file or as an OBJ file with embedded UVs.

## How to use Headus UVLayout Pro v2.09.00?
 
To use Headus UVLayout Pro v2.09.00, you need to follow these steps:

1. Download and install Headus UVLayout Pro v2.09.00 from [http://www.uvlayout.com/](http://www.uvlayout.com/). You can buy it or use the trial version for 30 days.
2. Run Headus UVLayout Pro v2.09.00 and open your 3D model file (OBJ, FBX, LWO, etc.) by clicking on File > Open or dragging and dropping it into the window.
3. Select the polygons or faces that you want to map by clicking on them or using the selection tools (Lasso, Rectangle, Circle, etc.). You can also select by material, group or shell.
4. Click on Edit > New UVs or press N to create a new UV map for the selected polygons or faces. You can also click on Edit > Load UVs or press L to load an existing UV map from another file.
5. Edit the UV map by using the tools in the toolbar (Cut, Weld 0f148eb4a0
